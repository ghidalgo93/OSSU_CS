# 1b: How to Design Functions

## Learning Goals

- Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions
that operate on primitive data.
- Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
- Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and
consistency with each other.
- Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem.

## How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe

The HtDF recipe consists of the following steps:

1. Signature, purpose and stub.
2. Define examples, wrap each in check-expect.
3. Template and inventory.
4. Code the function body.
5. Test and debug until correct
